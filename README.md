# Village Keep

This is the source code for the React Native mobile app whose home page is http://villagekeep.com.

To run locally you need to set up your own AWS resources.

- `yarn`
- `yarn global add amplify-cli`
- `amplify configure` (this creates aws-exports.js and other local files)
- `expo start`
